<p>B√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø is a flavorful Vietnamese noodle soup that originates from the central city of Hu·∫ø, known for its bold and spicy cuisine. The dish features a rich, aromatic broth made by simmering beef bones, lemongrass, and sometimes pork hocks, then seasoned with shrimp paste, chili oil, and fish sauce for depth and heat. It is typically served with thick round rice noodles and tender slices of beef shank, brisket, or oxtail, along with pork knuckles or Vietnamese ham (ch·∫£ l·ª•a). The soup is garnished with fresh herbs like cilantro, basil, and mint, plus lime wedges, bean sprouts, and shredded cabbage, creating a balance of savory, spicy, and refreshing flavors.</p>

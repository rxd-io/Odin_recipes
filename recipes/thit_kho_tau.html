  <h3>Thit Kho Tau Recipes</h3>
  <p>
   Th·ªãt Kho T√†u is a classic Vietnamese comfort dish made with pork belly and boiled eggs simmered in a savory-sweet caramelized sauce. The key ingredients include pork belly for richness, hard-boiled eggs for extra heartiness, fish sauce for deep umami flavor, coconut water to balance with natural sweetness, and sugar to create the signature amber caramel base. Aromatics like garlic, shallots, and black pepper bring warmth, while a splash of soy sauce (optional) adds depth. To cook it, the pork is first seared and caramelized with sugar until golden, then simmered gently in coconut water with fish sauce and seasonings until tender. The boiled eggs are added in to soak up the flavorful sauce, and the dish is served hot with freshly steamed rice, perfect for soaking up the rich, savory broth.
